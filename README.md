# Bootcamp on Native Application Development Using Flutter
Bootcamp on Native Application Development Using Flutter is organized by **IEEE Computer Society Brac University Student Branch Chapter**. The aim of this bootcamp is to introduce the enthusiasts to the amazing app development procedures using Flutter. By the end of the bootcamp, the attendees will have made their first 3 applications: A calculator app, a note app and a news app. A competition is arranged followed by the sessions to help the enthusiasts apply their newly gained knowledge.

# Bootcamp Breakdown
## **Difficulty: Beginner**
### **Content: Introduction to Flutter and Design Analysis**

Nowadays Mobile users expect their apps to have a beautiful design, smooth
animations and grand performance to deliver on developers need to create a new
feature faster than ever without compromising on quality or performance. That’s
why Google built flutter.
Flutter is Google’s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled
applications for mobile, web and desktop from a single codebase.
In the first session the attendees will able to understand the basis of Flutter App
Development, Installation of the IDE and Flutter, Dart a programming language
to develop a flutter app, the basis of a beautiful user-friendly app, project structure
breakdown to simplest level, why designs are important, analysis of some UI
designs, styling the app components etc.
### *The attendees will also learn how to make their own calculator app.*

- Basic introduction of flutter
- I thought Dart is a just a game
- Why would you use it?
- Installation of IDEs and Flutter
- Widget, widget and widget
- What is Hot reload?
- UI components
- Project structure breakdown

## **Difficulty: Moderate**
### **Content: Managing Multiple Screens and Routing Throughout the App**

Normally apps are not just built in a single screen. It consists of multiple screens
where you have to manage multiple screens where multiple type of data is shown
in the app screen. Sometimes you have to pass data between the screens. Details
of when and how you should use conditional screen changing, GitHub etc.
This session will show you how one can manage different screens and data model
to show screens, routing through the app screens, pass simple and custom Class
type objects, when and how to use conditional rendering and details of how one
can expand their app to multiple screens without making their life difficult with
the help of GitHub.
### *The attendees will also learn how to make a Note app.*
- Data modeling
- Conditional Rendering
- Multiple Screens
- Expanding the app to use multiple data models
- Passing simple and custom Class type object
- How NOT to use data models
- GitHub
- Make a Note App


## **Difficulty: Moderate**
### **Content: Asynchronous App Development to handle API**

API plays a huge role in software engineering. There are plenty of API that
provides us small data like today’s weather or large data like the whole world’s
flight info or news from New York Times etc.
This session will teach what APIs are, why they are important in our day to day
life and how to work with them in our apps. The attendees will understand how
to handle API calls, how to manage the state of the app when the data is loading,
or received or did not even load in their app.
### *The attendees will also learn and build a News app from scratch using an API.*
- API
- Asynchronous App Development
- Handling APIs
- Animations
- Creating the data model from scratch for the API
- Making the whole app from scratch using the created Data model
